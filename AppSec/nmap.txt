	Download and install:
sudo apt-get install nmap

	Check version if was preisntalled
nmap --version

	Help
nmap -h

	Keys:
-iL <inputFileName> - get targets from file
-v(vv) - more details, more 'v' more details
-iR <number> scan random targets 
--exclude <host1,[host2],[host3]> OR --excludefile <fileName>- exculue tagets, wprks if you work in diapsone e.g.
-Pn - scan without discovering(if you know ports what to scan)

	Discover types:
-sL - light scan, returns DNS server names, can find dev or vpn servers
-sn - ping scan, scan only IPs
-PS/PA/PU/PY - different ping scan types
-PR - ARP scan if in local network

	Scan types:
-sS - TCP SYN, most popular and more hidden
-sT - Connect()
-sA - ACK scanning, used to find firewall rules, what ports are filtered
-sW - Window scanning, almost the same as ACK but scan using type of realizations in systems, to separate ports for opened/closed
-sN - TCP Null no bits in flags, can pass throught firefalls and routers with packege filtartion
-sF - FIN bits, can pass throught firefalls and routers with packege filtartion
-sX - Xmas different bit types, can pass throught firefalls and routers with packege filtartion
-sM - Maimon scans use FIN ACK, can pass throught firefalls and routers with packege filtartion(can be usefull in BSD systems)
-sU - UDP Scan(some services are in udp) can be combined with other scan types, slower than another scan types
-sY - for mobile nets
-sO - scanning for IP protocols

	Port Specification
-p 21-1000 - scan port ranges
-p U:11,44,55,T:21-23,5,8800 -sU -sS - combine udp and tcp ports scanning
-p http,https,ftp - search by ports assosiated with specific protocols
-p0- scan all ports from 0 to 65555
-p-65555 - scan all ports from 0 to 65555
--exclude-perts 80,21,44-55 - exclude ports

	Service/Versions detection
-sV - scan services and their versions
--version-intensity (from 1 to 9) - scanning version more deeply 1 - easy, 9 - hard
--version-trace - show debug info

	OS Detection
-O - scan for OS detection(add -v for more details)
--osscan-limit - scans only perpective targets if open and closed tcp ports are present

	Script Scan
-Sc - scan with default script
--scipt default,safe -v -O -sV - scan using scripts from default and safe categories(os and version detection is needed for some scripts)
--script==banner - scan using 'banner' script
--script="http-*" - use all scripts starting with 'htpp-'
